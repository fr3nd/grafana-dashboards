# Grafana Dashboards

Grafana is an open source, feature rich metrics dashboard and graph editor for Graphite, InfluxDB & OpenTSDB.

While it's very useful to manually generate custom graphs, if you have a big number of servers and you just want to view a quick overview of what's going on, having to generate each graph manually is not very convenient.

Fortunatelly, Grafana allows to do [Scripted Dashboards](http://docs.grafana.org/reference/scripting/) using JavaScript.

Those are the scripts I created to fetch the data generated by CollectD and stored into InfluxDB 0.9 and generate graphs for each one of the hosts you pass as a parameter.

## Scripted dashboards

Check [Grafana scripted dashboards documentation](http://docs.grafana.org/reference/scripting/) for instructions on how to install scripted dashboards
